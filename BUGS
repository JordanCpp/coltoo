tracker. For links, see README.


- Gold amount

The gold amount can go negative; there is no check if 
the player can afford what he's trying to pay for.


- No screen redraw after alt-tab

On Windows there are some issues when returning to the full-
screen game with alt-tab.

When returning to the map the screen is black except for the
tile with the current unit. When moving, the entire screen
is redrawn.

When returning to the HCS the entire screen is black as
well. Only the box with the available units is redrawn when
moving the mouse over them.


- Shrouded units

Foreign units are full-colored under the partial shroud,
unlike Natives (which are grayed). 


- 100% CPU when idling

The game uses 100% CPU when nothing is happening. This
affects overall system performance.


- Game window too big

The game window is too big for a monitor running on 1024*768
and can't be resized.

As a consequence part of the screen is inaccessible/hidden.

NOTE: the game uses full-screen mode by default. It is not
recommended to switch to window mode via options.xml.
