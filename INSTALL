COLONIZATION TOO INSTALLATION NOTES - build 03j


- WINDOWS

Colonization Too was tested on most Win32 systems, including
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.
The Windows version requires several open source libraries,
available as DLLs. These libraries are:

SDL.dll
SDL_image.dll
SDL_ttf.dll

If these libraries are not included in your package, you can
download them either all in one from the project site:
http://www.civgaming.net/col2/datafiles/runtime.zip
or separately, from the SDL site http://libsdl.org.
Also, make sure your configuration supports 1024*768.

The code was compiled using the Mingw32 compilers; Mingw32
is included in Dev-Cpp IDE, which is used for Colonization
Too development. You can either use the .dev file in Dev-Cpp
or compile it using the small "build-mingw32.exe" utility.
You will also need headers and .a import libraries for SDL.


- UNIX/LINUX

The code was tested with Debian GNU/Linux, kernel 2.6.x, SDL
1.2.x, XFree86 4.x. Testing reports for any other platforms
and configurations are always welcome.
To run the game, you must have SDL, SDL_image and SDL_ttf
libraries installed; you can download them from the SDL site
http://libsdl.org.
To compile the code, just run make-release.sh. The debug .sh
file is needed for developers to turn on debug output.

Before running, make sure your X Window System is configured
to support 1024*768 resolution. Also make sure you run it
from an X session and not directly from the console.
